## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [checkForSuccessfulExecution(createRequestMock)](./ibm-cloud-sdk-core.unittestutils.checkforsuccessfulexecution.md) | This method simply ensures that the method executed without any issues by extracting the argument from the mock object for the <code>createRequest</code> method and verifying that it is an object. |
|  [checkMediaHeaders(createRequestMock, accept, contentType)](./ibm-cloud-sdk-core.unittestutils.checkmediaheaders.md) | Takes the mock object for the <code>createRequest</code> method, extracts the headers that were sent with the call, and checks for the expected values for <code>Accept</code> and <code>Content-Type</code>. This to verify that the SDK sets the correct values in the code. |
|  [checkUrlAndMethod(options, url, method)](./ibm-cloud-sdk-core.unittestutils.checkurlandmethod.md) | Takes the request options constructed by the SDK and checks that the <code>url</code> and <code>method</code> properties were set to their correct values. |
|  [checkUserHeader(createRequestMock, userHeaderName, userHeaderValue)](./ibm-cloud-sdk-core.unittestutils.checkuserheader.md) | Takes the mock object for the <code>createRequest</code> method, extracts the headers that were sent with the call, and checks for the expected value for a user-defined header. This is verify that the SDK accepts header parameters and sends them as headers in the request. |
|  [expectToBePromise(sdkPromise)](./ibm-cloud-sdk-core.unittestutils.expecttobepromise.md) | This method simply ensures that the SDK methods return Promises by checking for the <code>then</code> function - common way to assess whether or not an object is a Promise. |
|  [getOptions(createRequestMock)](./ibm-cloud-sdk-core.unittestutils.getoptions.md) | This method extracts the <code>options</code> property from the object passed into <code>createRequest</code>. This property is an object containing all of the SDK method-specific information (like <code>path</code> and <code>body</code>) used to build a request. This method is just a convenience method for the unit tests to be able to make assertions on the items in the request. |
